## Where are you really from and other FAQs...
In a competitive program focused on math (北师大实验), I won three years' of scholarship for performing at top 5%.
 
I moved to Vancouver, Canada to have an art education for a good portion of high school. Sometime around then, I changed my mind.

I have been invited to the Canadian Math Olympiad, the Canadian Math Seminar, and the Asia Pacific Math Olympiad.

I went to Mathcamp. Later, I co-directed Caltech-Harvey Mudd Math Contests.

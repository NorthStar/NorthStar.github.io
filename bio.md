Mimee Xu builds privacy-critical machine learning infrastructure.

Her current work focuses on two complementary directions:

(1) achieving exact unlearning through data-flexible training, including training that supports reversible data inclusion (as introduced in [*Netflix and Forget*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.06676)), and 

(2) establishing [Secure Computation](https://privacyml.github.io/) as foundational infrastructure for evaluation over encrypted datasets and computations, as well as for data acquisition and model auditing over sensitive data. Together, this work enables oversight and accountability mechanisms to operate without exposing underlying data.

As a Research Fellow at the Information Law Institute at NYU, Xu’s ongoing work on Privacy of the Mind examines how AI-mediated cognition poses a novel systemic risk, and how emerging technical capabilities should modernize privacy protection law and inform the development of new legal doctrines.

Xu earned her PhD in Computer Science from the NYU Courant Institute in 2025. Her dissertation advanced scalable secure computation techniques for dataset valuation, model evaluation, and encrypted auditing. Prior to her doctorate, she worked in machine learning engineering on large-scale production systems. Her industrial experience, incidentally split between U.S. technology companies (Google, Facebook) and Chinese research labs in the U.S. (Baidu, ByteDance).

She is also a field-builder in the systems community, having grown [Machine Learning for Systems](mlforsystems.org)—a longstanding NeurIPS workshop—for seven years, and is particularly interested in in-person coordination across technical, legal, and policy domains.
